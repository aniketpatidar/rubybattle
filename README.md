# CodeKata

CodeKata is a platform for developers who want to sharpen their Ruby skills through practice, competition, and community. Solve challenges on your own, race a friend head-to-head, or talk through a problem in the discussion forum — it's all here in one place.

## What it does

**Code challenges** — A growing library of Ruby problems across easy, medium, and hard difficulty. Each challenge runs your code against real test cases and tells you exactly what passed and what didn't.

**Head-to-head duels** — Invite a friend to solve the same challenge at the same time. First one to pass all test cases wins. The editor syncs live so you can see each other's output as it happens.

**Collaborative editor** — Share a room link and write code together in real time. Useful for pair programming, walkthroughs, or just getting unstuck.

**Discussions** — A community forum for asking questions, sharing solutions, and talking through approaches. Threads are votable so the best answers surface naturally.

**Notifications & connections** — Send connection requests to other users, get notified when someone invites you to a duel or replies to your post.
